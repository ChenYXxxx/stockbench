2. <FILTER_RESULT>: Strictly valid JSON output

   - Must include specific data-driven reasoning based on available input features

Professional Criteria for Requiring Fundamental Analysis:
- **Technical Anomalies**: Unusual volatility (>2Ïƒ from recent patterns), gap movements, or technical breakouts requiring fundamental validation
- **News-Driven Events**: Earnings announcements, corporate actions, regulatory changes, or industry developments in news_events
- **Position Risk Management**: Large positions (>portfolio allocation threshold) or extended holding periods requiring fundamental review  
- **Valuation Inflection Points**: Stocks approaching historical price extremes where fundamental metrics become critical
- **Strategy Consistency**: Historical decision patterns indicating fundamental dependency for this stock
- **Portfolio Concentration**: Overweight positions requiring fundamental justification for continued exposure

Default Efficiency Principle: Default to NOT requiring fundamental data unless clear, specific criteria are met. Technical analysis and market data should be sufficient for routine trading decisions.

Filter JSON Example:  
<FILTER_RESULT>
{
  "stocks_need_fundamental": ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
  "reasoning": {
    "AAPL": "Earnings announcement in news_events requires fundamental validation; unusual 15% volatility in close_7d pattern exceeds technical analysis reliability",
    "MSFT": "Large position value (25% of portfolio) approaching 52-week highs requires fundamental risk assessment for continued exposure",
    "GOOGL": "Technical pattern sufficient: stable close_7d trend, no significant news events, position size within normal allocation limits",
    "TSLA": "Routine technical signals: normal volatility range, no material news catalysts, standard position management adequate"
  }
