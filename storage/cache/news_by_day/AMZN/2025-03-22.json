      "description": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has only delivered back-to-back annual gains of 25% or more (including dividends) on two occasions in its history dating back to 1957: during the dot-com internet boom in 1997 and 1998, and during the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in 2023 and 2024.  The gains over the last two years have been driven by some of the largest companies in the index, including multitrillion-dollar giants like Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.  In other words, investors who haven't owned those four stocks over the last two years have probably underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.",
