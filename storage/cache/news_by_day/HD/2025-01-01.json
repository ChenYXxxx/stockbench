      "description": "E-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) trounced the market in 2024, with its share price climbing 45% compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24% gains (as of this writing).  Meanwhile, Home Depot's (NYSE: HD) shares struggled, gaining just 12.4% for the year amid a slowdown in DIY home improvement spending.  Both of these consumer goods companies are leaders in their respective markets and, while their current share price gains don't compare, either could be great long-term investments.",
