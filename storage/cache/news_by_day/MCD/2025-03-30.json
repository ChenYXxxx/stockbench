      "description": "In the fourth quarter of 2024, fast-food giant McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) raised its quarterly dividend from $1.67 per share to $1.77 per share.  If it raises its dividend again before the end of 2025, McDonald's will extend its streak to 50 years, placing it among the elite Dividend Kings.
