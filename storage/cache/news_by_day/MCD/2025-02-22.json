      "description": "McDonald's, the largest restaurant chain in the world, has underperformed the S&P 500 by 20% over the last five years. The company has faced challenges, including an E. Coli outbreak and declining global comparable sales. While McDonald's is trying to spur sales through value options and new items, analysts believe the company's performance may not make it a strong investment compared to its competitors.",

The company's recent financial results and forward guidance also suggest a lack of strong growth potential."
