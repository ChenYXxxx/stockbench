The earnings underscore investor preference for companies shielded from tariff-related risks amid persistent uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based insurer's net written premiums rose 7.2% to a record $3.35 billion in the quarter, as businesses and individuals continued to invest in insurance coverage to guard against risks despite a period of economic uncertainty.",
