      "description": "(Reuters) -Hackers are tricking employees at companies in Europe and the Americas into installing a modified version of a Salesforce-related app, allowing the hackers to steal reams of data, gain access to other corporate cloud services and extort those companies, Google said on Wednesday.  The hackers – tracked by the Google Threat Intelligence Group as UNC6040 – have “proven particularly effective at tricking employees” into installing a modified version of Salesforce’s Data Loader, a proprietary tool used to bulk import data into Salesforce environments, the researchers said.  The hackers use voice calls to trick employees into visiting a purported Salesforce connected app setup page to approve the unauthorized, modified version of the app, created by the hackers to emulate Data Loader.",
