      "description": "Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced first results from Cohort 4 of the Phase 2b SunRISe-1 study evaluating TAR-200—an intravesical gemcitabine releasing system—for patients with certain types of bladder cancer. These first results show the promise of TAR-200 in this patient population with more than an 80 percent disease-free survival (DFS) rate without the need for reinduction and 94 percent of patients able to preserve their bladder. The high DFS and bladder preservation rate combine",
