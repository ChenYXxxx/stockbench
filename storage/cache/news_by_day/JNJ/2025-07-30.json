      "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. companies are removing their CEOs at the fastest clip in two decades, data shows, as increased scrutiny from shareholders and boards result in reduced tolerance for sub-par returns or wayward conduct.

In the latest example, consumer goods company Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels, said on Monday CEO Jon Moeller will be replaced next year by longtime executive Shailesh Jejurikar.",
