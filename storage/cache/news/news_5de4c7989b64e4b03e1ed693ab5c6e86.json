      "description": "E-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) trounced the market in 2024, with its share price climbing 45% compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24% gains (as of this writing).  Meanwhile, Home Depot's (NYSE: HD) shares struggled, gaining just 12.4% for the year amid a slowdown in DIY home improvement spending.  Both of these consumer goods companies are leaders in their respective markets and, while their current share price gains don't compare, either could be great long-term investments.",

      "description": "The sputtering U.S. housing market is hurting the businesses that depend on Americans opening their wallets to fix up and furnish their new homes.  Retailers announced more U.S. store closures than openings in 2024, according to data firm Coresight Research, reversing a two-year trend of net openings.  Home retailers were one of the biggest drivers of the contraction, with companies such as  Big Lots  and  Conn’s  filing for bankruptcy and announcing plans to close hundreds of locations.",
