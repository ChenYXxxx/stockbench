      "description": "There has been some interesting and mixed news flow around  Boeing (NYSE: BA) recently.  A Reuters article cited a White House official who stated that deliveries of the two Boeing VC-25B planes that will serve as the next \"Air Force One\" could be delayed until 2029, after Boeing's previous delays pushed the delivery dates into 2027 or 2028.  A Bloomberg article claimed that key airline customer Emirates now expects that deliveries of the 205 Boeing 777X widebody jets it ordered won't begin to take place any sooner than the second quarter of 2027, and possibly won't start until 2028.",
