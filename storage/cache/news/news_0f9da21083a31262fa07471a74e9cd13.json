      "description": "Altria, a consumer staples company known for its cigarette products, offers a high dividend yield of 7.4%. However, the company's core cigarette business is facing a concerning decline in volume, with a 10.2% drop in 2024. While Altria has tried to diversify into vaping and marijuana, these efforts have not been successful. The article suggests that the accelerating risk in Altria's business may not be worth it for the average dividend investor.",
