The hackers – tracked by the Google Threat Intelligence Group as UNC6040 – have “proven particularly effective at tricking employees” into installing a modified version of Salesforce’s Data Loader, a proprietary tool used to bulk import data into Salesforce environments, the researchers said.  The hackers use voice calls to trick employees into visiting a purported Salesforce connected app setup page to approve the unauthorized, modified version of the app, created by the hackers to emulate Data Loader.",
