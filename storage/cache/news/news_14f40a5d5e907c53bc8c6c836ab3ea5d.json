      "description": "Walmart has rewarded investors with outsized gains.  Last year, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) soared 71.9%, making it one of the best performers in the S&P 500 and the second-best performing component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (behind only Nvidia).  Walmart is following up on that impressive performance with a 6.7% year-to-date gain at the time of this writing, which is far better than the S&P 500's 2.1% decline.",

Durable financial performance, a strong brand, and network effects are probably why this leading financial services entity is a top Buffett holding.
