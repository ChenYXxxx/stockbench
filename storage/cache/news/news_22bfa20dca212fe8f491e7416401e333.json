      "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) -Emirates has not seen any impact from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, but remains cautious due to ongoing uncertainty, the airline's Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim told Reuters on Wednesday.  Kazim said delays in aircraft deliveries had prompted Emirates to accelerate its $5 billion fleet retrofitting programme, first announced in 2021, allowing it to maintain capacity amid surging demand and supply shortages.  Emirates, the largest airline in the United Arab Emirates and a key contributor to its economy, is the world's biggest operator of Boeing 777 jets and one of the largest cargo carriers globally.",

      "description": "A senior U.S. lawmaker has warned Ryanair against purchasing Chinese-made aircraft due to security concerns, following comments by the CEO of the low-cost Irish airline that he would consider buying Chinese jets at the right price, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  Ryanair responded to the letter by saying it would consider cancelling planes it has on order from Boeing if U.S. tariffs materially affect the price and look at alternatives, including Chinese planemaker COMAC.  U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, said in the April 29 letter to Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that COMAC has close ties to the Chinese military and that evidence indicates it has benefited from the illicit acquisition of foreign intellectual property.",
